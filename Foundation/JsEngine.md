### Flow ###

# Parser --> 
# AST(abstract syntax tree) -->
# Interpreter --> Bytes as output || Profiler


### Compiler vs Interpreter. ###

# compiler trying to understand what we have wrote and rewrite in other language.
# it's optimize the code, but doesn't do it on the fly.
# (like babel & typescript)

# interpreter is translate on fly the code into byte code.

# JIT Compiler --> just in time compiler, combination of interpreter & compiler.
